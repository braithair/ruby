# Scripts

## Learning and Tools
The scripts and code in this subsection are based on helping you learn, as well as looking at some useful toolkits. The Koans are a learning tool for Ruby, and are very useful in helping you understand Ruby. More information on the Koans can be found in the [Ruby Wiki](https://github.com/braithair/ruby/wiki/Ruby).

Other scripts below, like `rbconfig.rb` and `rbconfighostos.rb` are toolkits which help determine the OS you are running from. I had a use case, and it was worthwhile.
