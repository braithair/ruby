## 1. Amazon EC2 
Running an Amazon EC2 instance can be a great way to host a flexible, scalable and potentially inexpensive (#EC2NanoPls) linux operating system. Starting up an Amazon account is pretty straight forward. <br />

## 2. Using Git 
Using Git is important to work through code uploads and updates. Knowing some of the fundamentals can be important. Here we will assume that you have Github support installed on your Linux/Mac/Windows system, to assit in handling Git commands. <br />

a. Git Basics <br />
Let's say you have some files you've been coding with locally, but now you want to store and share your coding journey! Well, this is what Git is for. You have options to push your local code into Github's cloud service where it can be modified, improved and available for you on any device you want to code on! <br />
<br />
So, let's start with some basics. You've got that local code and you want to upload it to a safe haven. <br />
<br />
I'll make this first section breif, make a Github account and create a repository. You're flying solo on this bit! Trust me, it's easy and you'll start getting a feel for making repositories in Github. <br />
<br />
**Note: When you initialise that 'repo', make sure you create a Readme.md (It's basically the same this as this document you're reading. Really hand to convey information to your reader, and to document your design process! :) <br />

<br />
... waiting ... <br /> 

Great, you've got a repository on Github, you'll have an important URL to that 'repo'. It's going to look something like: https://github.com/braithair/ruby/ <br />
<br />
Now that you have that repostory, you want to store your code up in that

b. Removing sensitive data from a repository <br />
Be realllllllly mindful of the information you are pushing up into Github. NEVER sync files that contain sensitive information such as SSH keys, password (bad practise if you're a programmer!), Personal access keys and other private information. See section 3d if you need more information about SECURITY*** <br />

c. Creating a Personal Access Key (for MFA/2FA protected Github Accounts) <br />

The links above assist greatly with any assistance you may require in knowing some of the Github fundamentals. Consider them as an introduction into some of the features that are useful when commiting, pushing or pulling with Github. <br />

## 3. Installing Ruby
Installing Ruby can be quick and painless, depending on your operating system (Looking your way windows!).
